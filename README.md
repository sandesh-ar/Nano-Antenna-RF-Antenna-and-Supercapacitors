# 0verview
This project report focuses on the development and implementation of RF Antennas for energy harvesting from electromagnetic radiation and Supercapacitors for efficient energy storage. The study was conducted under the Mini-Project Exhibition at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bengaluru, under the banner of the 0.7 Technical Club

# Objectives
1.	RF Antenna:	   
        1.Harvesting voltage from electromagnetic (RF) signals.
                    
     2.Understanding the conversion of electromagnetic energy into electrical energy.


2.	Supercapacitors:  
      1.Storing charge through chemical reactions in an electrolyte.

    2.Efficient energy discharge when required


# Methodology
1.	RF Antenna:
        
     1.The RF antenna captures electromagnetic waves and converts the carried energy into an electrical signal.

     2.This process involves a transducer, which converts one form of energy (electromagnetic) into another (electrical).

     3.The captured energy can then be processed by an electronic device, such as a radio receiver.
