This project report focuses on the development and implementation of RF Antennas for energy harvesting from electromagnetic radiation and Supercapacitors for efficient energy storage. The study was conducted under the Mini-Project Exhibition at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bengaluru, under the banner of the 0.7 Technical Club

# Objectives
1.	RF Antenna:
o	Harvesting voltage from electromagnetic (RF) signals.
o	Understanding the conversion of electromagnetic energy into electrical energy.
2.	Supercapacitors:
o	Storing charge through chemical reactions in an electrolyte.
o	Efficient energy discharge when required
